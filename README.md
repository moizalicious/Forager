As you may have heard, our team, comprised of Byung, Moiz and myself, have been selected into the final four teams to do the Google NLU challenge. Our task is to crowdsource data for Google's Conversation AI, using an Android app we created that presents you with comments to rate.

Google's Conversation AI assesses the toxicity of comments found online. The data we provide will be the basis of its judgments.

As such, we would greatly appreciate your help with high-quality submissions over the data collection period.

Our target is to submit at least 10000 data items, so please try to assess at least 25-50 comments a day.

The amount of comments left to reach the target can be viewed at any time from the Community Page, so that you can see how your contributions are helping us reach the target.

As additional incentive, we will also be donating a portion of the prize money to charity.

Please download the .apk supplied to start contributing, and good luck!
