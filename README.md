### <a name="challenge"></a>Google NLU Challenge
Taken from the Google NLU Challenge's [Call for Proposals](https://goo.gl/Dx4ozJ):
>Google is inviting teams of developers to participate in the Google NLU Challenge in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from October 7 to 30, 2017. Teams will be asked to develop a crowdsourcing mobile app and then manage the collection of labeled data. The collected data will be useful for machine learning that powers an open-source system for natural language understanding (NLU).

Team Diaspora was selected as one of the final four teams from Sri Lanka to do the Google NLU challenge. Our task is to crowdsource data for Google's [Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io/), using an Android app, which would present users with comments taken from real-world sources and ask them to rate how toxic the comments are. This is what we came up with.

### <a name="concept"></a>Concept
A big focus for our project was gamification of what would otherwise be a boring task, so we eventually came up with the concept of a tribe undertaking a long journey to find a new home.

The player, as a newly minted brave of this new tribe, must help the tribe survive as they move towards their promised land. They do this by foraging around the surrounding area, which we represented by the retrieval and rating of comments) for food, as the tribe moves along on their journey. For every good judgement you make, you bring the tribe closer to the end of their journey. For every bad judgement you make, you add more distance to the journey your tribe must travel. **This means that every decision you make is real, and that your errors will affect everyone playing.**
